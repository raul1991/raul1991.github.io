<p>
  I have been working as a programmer for the last 9+ years in the software
  industry. Although, I started my career as an Android application developer
  but I slowly delved into backend development. Since then, I've worked with
  multiple stacks and technologies in the past. Most recently, I led a team in
  my previous org to transition their monolith telecom application to cloud.
</p>
<p>
  I have a huge appetite and an everlasting itch to create side projects. Most
  of them started as a problem in my work or my personal life. One of the
  projects, I am proud of is
  <a href="https://github.com/raul1991/diver.js">diver.js</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I go by the name
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1270865/cafebabe1991"
    >cafebabe1991</a
  >
  on stackoverflow so if you ever received an answer by someone with that name
  there, it would probably be me.

<p class="mb-5">
  When I am not coding or learning to code different things out there, I like to
  read books, watch anime (DragonBall), do yoga and write poems to log my
  feelings.

  Here is <a href="https://bit.ly/3HgDX1e">my resume</a> in case you are
  interested.
