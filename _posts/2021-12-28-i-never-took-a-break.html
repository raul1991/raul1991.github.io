  Since the pandemic, the internet was rife with the term burn out along with
  other mental health buzz words. To be honest, I never really cared about them
  and kept going at my regular pace. In fact, during the first few months into
  the lockdown, I started clocking more hours than I used to. In the start, it
  surely gave me good results like getting more things done but I had to pay a
  big price for it. This blog is about that bad habit and how I am trying to get
  rid of it.
</p>

<p>
  I started my career in small startups where the work was great and every day
  was filled with challenges and new learnings related to work. However, the
  work culture wasn't that great, and overclocking was normal. Even though my
  recent work environment had great work culture and amazing work-life balance,
  I never really got out of my older habits. These habits manifested themselves
  in form of me having late lunches, not getting up from my seat for a very long
  period, and having bad posture. The good part was that I had to take a cab
  from the office which acted as a psychological shift from the work setting to
  the home setting. Unfortunately, even this didn't last long when the pandemic
  started.
</p>
<p>
  As soon as the pandemic started, we were all remote, and rides back home were
  no more available and I was always in a work setting despite being at home.
  So, the first few months into the pandemic, I felt the exhaustion but I still
  kept going on. I was getting more responsibilities, the pressure was building
  up but I was liking what I was doing so I ignored all the signs and kept on
  focussing on the work. These bad habits continued until I realized the state I
  was in. My body had been showing me the symptoms yet I ignored them all along.
  The result was anxiety, lack of interest, fatigue, and lack of clarity in what
  I was doing.
</p>
<p>
  Again, my ignorant self tried to sequester these symptoms with a bullshit
  phrase like "It'll go away" but it didn't work. This time, I knew something
  was off and that is when I started reading about it. I realized what I was
  going through was burn out but what I couldn't find out was a way to get out
  of it. But I knew, I had to take time off and do something recreational or at
  least something for my mental well-being.
</p>
<p>
  This is when I finally joined yoga to do something for my mental well-being.
  It also made me realize that any form of exercise is paramount for a healthier
  mind. Within a few weeks, I could notice that my health was improving but the
  anxiety and lack of interest in my work were still my problems. This was a
  harder problem for its impact was subconscious. This is because I never really
  had a hobby apart from coding so my professional and personal space were
  deeply intertwined. I wanted a break from my relationship with work. So I
  started taking regular recharge days, going out, watching movies, organizing
  my stuff (yes I like this ðŸ˜†), or reading books. In summary, I did everything
  that didn't involve coding or using my laptop. I am continuing these habits
  and the results are showing but slowly.
</p>
<p>
  I wish I had paid attention to all this way sooner before I got lost. So, if
  you are reading this and you are dealing with something similar, pause for a
  moment and take care of yourself and find your peace.

<p>Take care and pay attention to your body.</p>
